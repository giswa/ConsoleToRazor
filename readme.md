# From Console to Razor

This project was started to understand dotnet core and razor. 
Goal is to create a "from scratch" razor app, and to have the minimum necessary code and packages.

The project was first started using the standard console scafolding :
```shell
dotnet new console 
```


Note:

The project was started in 2019 using dotnet core 2.2
Next step would be to migrated a newer version

In .net core 2.2 the razor pages goes throught MVC app logic
